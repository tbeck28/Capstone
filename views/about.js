    <p>I am a one man team. My name is Quinn, I live in St Louis and I am a beginning developer, this is my first application. The idea behind this was while on a hiatus from jiu jitsu, I was watching my friends compete, and it was just a horrible experience. It was very unorganized, I had to have multiple tabs open to track my friends matches and I just thought there had to be a better way to do this and after not finding it, I decided I would just make a way. I wanted it to be easy to use and to be able to make changes to the selection of athletes as quick as possible.</p>
